In this section, you will load data into your DynamoDB table and configure your OpenSearch Service resources.

Before beginning this section, make sure that [setup](https://catalog.workshops.aws/dynamodb-labs/en-US/dynamodb-opensearch-zetl/setup/) has been completed for whichever way you're running this lab. Setup will deploy several resources.

- S3 Bucket: Used to store the initial export of DynamoDB data for the Zero-ETL Pipeline.
- IAM Role: Used to grant permissions for pipeline integration and queries.
- Cloud9 IDE: Console for executing commands, building integrations, and running sample queries.

zETL CloudFormation Template Resources:
